#Alignment

Alignment is the flow of a text document. This sets the text flow and image placement for a page, column, table, or tab. Alignment is also known as range, text-alignment, text justification, or type justification.

## Four Types of Alignment

When you pick alignment for a website, always chose one that is easier to read.

###1.Flush Left
Flush left alignment is where content is aligned on the left margin with ragged edges on the right. This is the most legible option because of consistent word spaces and no big holes between the text. The left margin is even and easy to maintain. You must make sure the lines arenâ€™t too short or very long. Keep your hyphenation at a minimum.

###2.Flushed Right
Flushed right aligns content on the right margin with left edges ragged. This is not a good choice for long bodies of text since it is harder to read. Developers use flushed right alignment to show closer relationships between elements in columns. This type of alignment is used for sidebars, captions, marginal notes among large chunks of information. It is also used as a way to get smaller text to sit closer to the right edge of the page.

###Centered
Centered alignment aligns content in the center of the page. This type of alignment has gaps on the sides of each line. The content is not in either the left or right margins, making it difficult for users to find the beginning of new lines of text. Centered alignment is not a good choice for long bodies of text.

Examples using centered alignment: invitations, titles, certificates, pull quotes, and discrete pieces of information.

###Justified

Justified alignment is set flush with both left and right margins. A solid rectangle is created on the page.  It is easy to read and has a formal feeling. Justified alignment is a popular choice due to the way it uses space on a website. You can see justified alignment in newspapers and books.

When you use justify alignment, pay attention to the rivers or gaps that pop up in the text. These gaps can appear in small number of words, giving poor spacing or too much hyphenation. Developers have some control to prevent rivers on a web page, but it is harder to achieve. If you want more control over the justified alignment, CSS3 has the text-justify property and hypens which help developers get more control.
