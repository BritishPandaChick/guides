User flow is the path users take to complete specific tasks on a website. The path a user takes can affect your conversions. The right user flow will give designers clear conversions and show the journey users take to complete a specific goal action.

## What are your objectives?

Every website has goals or actions users should do. Websites have specific steps that guide users towards each of the objectives that need to be met.  Therefore each goal needs to be valuable for both the business and users. Possible goal actions can be signing up for a newsletter or purchasing a product. 

Before you start designing your website, start thinking about the goal actions users need to do and information about user objectives. User objectives are the desires or needs they need to satisfy. Be as clear as possible with both set of goals. Clear, specific goals objectives make it easier to create design flows and help all the goals that need to be met.

## How do users get to your site?

Once you know the goals, map out possible entry points users to get to your website. Designers plan the path users should take to get from the entry point to the goal action. 

Possible entry points include:

*Organic search
*Paid advertising
*Social Media
*Email
*Press or news item
*Direct link

You must remember to treat every user differently. Users end on a website for different reasons, needs, and expectations. The best user flows consider both the user and all the goals. Use your user personas and interview customers. This will help you determine what areas to specifically focus on. All the steps move the user one step closer to a goal action.
